		<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Devin is a sophomore in college and currently attends the University Of New Mexico. He is a biology major and his life is consumed with studying and labs. Lately he has found himself dissatisfied with his social life. He doesn't go out a lot and is not engaged in a lot of hobbies, so his friend group is limited to the people that he meets in class. He is tired of not having anything to do and wants to find a way to go to events, so he can meet new people and have fun.
